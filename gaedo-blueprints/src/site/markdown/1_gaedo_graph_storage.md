## Foreword ##

This document tries to explain how data is to be stored when using gaedo-blueprints. Obviously, concepts regarding gaedo are supposed to be understood here (namely the distinction between managed classes - the beans that are persisted - and service classes -the objects that are used to persist those beans).

As an aside, a basic knowledge of what graphs are (and aren't) could be useful.

Finally, knowing how [blueprints][1] and its specific [neo4j][2] [adaptation layer][3] work is of obvious use (as they're used in all examples and unit tests for `gaedo-blueprints`).

# How to store an object graph into a persistent graph ? #

A simple question, no ? Well, in fact, not so.

Let's start with a basic example ... our beloved `Tag` class (see in `gaedo-test-beans`) in its first version.

If we look at that class its fields are few :

	public class Tag extends Identified implements Serializable {
		private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Tag.class.getName());
		
		private String text;
		
	}
	
## Storing properties as properties ##

We could imagine storing each of the non-static (and non-transient, of course) fields of that class as one of Tag associated [vertex][4] properties. Something like `text` could do the trick, no ? This simple solution would lead to that graph :

![A graph where properties are stored as vertex properties](images/gaedo_graph_storage_1_graph_with_properties.jpg)

Well, it would immediatly raise some issues :

 1. What if two `Tag` share the same text ?
 2. What if `Tag` class had a subclass containing an other `text` property.

## Storing properties as edges ##

Both issues can be solved by changes in the storage paradigm to make it converge with some basic concepts of graph theory.

 1. Each property of an object should be stored as an [edge][5] linking the object (as edge source) to the property value.
 2. Each edge name should be built from class name and property name instead of simple property value

Which lead to this second simple graph :

![A graph where properties are stored as edges linking vertices representing property owner and property value](images/gaedo_graph_storage_2_graph_with_relationships.jpg)

Well, this second graph is better by multiple aspects. Indeed, as relationships are named from class (implementation uses full class name, instead of this tutorial-level one which uses simple class name) and property name, there is now only one relationship linking a `Tag` to its `text`, and its named `Tag:text`. which is a good name. Furthermore, any `Tag` using the `"tag text"` text will be linked to this very vertex. Which is undoubtly a very ood thing if we plan to find all `Tag`instances using this text (don't worry, queries will have their very own documentation).

But

What if I want to use the `"3"` text ? Will instances be linked to the vertex that also represent the `3` integer number and the `3.0` float number ? That question troubled me a lot.

And what if I want to use the `"Tag:1"` text ? That object is clearly not the same that `Tag:1` is, no ? But, according to previous definition, they would be stored using the same vertex, which is now visibly unthinkable.

## Adding type informations ##

So I introduce here some supplementary properties (which will make that graph even more semantic-a-like)

![A graph that make gaedo very similar to semantic web](images/gaedo_graph_storage_3_graph_with_relationships_and_semantic_types.jpg)

These properties are kinda special, let me explain them a little more

 * **kind** can be `uri`, for vertices linked to others, `bnode` for vertices without specifc ids, and `literal` for all those literal values you know and love (like strings, numbers, dates, and so on). That `kind` property is defined on all vertices gaedo access.
 * **type** is defined only on vertices of `literal` `kind`. It contains a definition of the type used for that value. Notice that, instead of using standard Java type, I try to use semantic visions of those types. As a consequence, a Java string will be represented by a `xsd:string`.

We're quite at the end of that introduction to gaedo graph storage. Except for one thing ... a `Tag` is a `Tag`, but it's also an instance of all its superclasses (like `Identified`, as an example). Suppose, as an example, we're looking for all `Identified` instances which `id` is greater than 3. How could we do ? We could explore the java classes extending `Identified` (as an example using [reflections][6]) then search all of their instances. But, admit it, it's clearly not oriented towards graph navigation : this kind of process would be like taking some nodes quite at random to examine them.

## Adding links to classes ##

This leads to the effective implementation exposed below

![A real-world graph complete with links to classes and to id](images/gaedo_graph_storage_4_real_world_tag_graph.png)

You can see that each object is linked to all of its classes using the `Object:classes` edge. Furthermore, it is linked to its effective class using the `Object:type` edge. One should notice that these edge exist, even if the object expose absolutely no property regarding its classes (which is the case of the Tag class).

So, to your mind, is it possible to recreate the `Tag` object this graph represents ?

We know some things :

 * its `com.dooapp.gaedo.test.beans.Tag:text` is a string which value is `"tag text"`
 * its `com.dooapp.gaedo.test.beans.Identified:id` is a long which value is `1`
 * its `java.lang.Object:classes` are `Identified`, `Serializable` and `Tag`
 * and its `java.lang.Object:type` is also `Tag`

which makes it a Tag with id `1` and text `tag text`.

One may however ask where is the `Tag#rendering` property. It is easy, it is missing. And it is missing because its value is null, which we **never** represent.

# Conclusion #

As one can see, the implementation rendered is conceptually similar to the one a `SaigGraph` can produce, and for a good reason : all objects stored by gaedo in graphc an be exported as RDF statements, like `GraphPostFinderServiceTest#allowExport()` test method clearly shows.

But, as the documentation about queries explain, it is absolutely not the only advantage of that persistence strategy. Unfortunatly, this leads to one big - and unknown when this implementation was forged - drawback : the supernode problem. This will be fixed by gaedo 1.0 (which unfortunatly break absolutly all this). For more informations, see [Overcoming supernodes by the grace of heavy nodes and indices][7].
