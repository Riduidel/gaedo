GAEDO
=====

Gaedo initially stood for "Google App Engine Data Object", but has since evolved into a more general Java persistence layer, supporting:

* Google App Engine
* Prevalence
* all graph implementations compatible with the Blueprints stack.

I used to publish a long index containing all versions of gaedo, but we've been too far.

Now, to see whcih is latest version, I urge you to go take a look at [maven central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|gaedo), which clearly knows which is the latest version.
