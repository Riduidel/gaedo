GAEDO
=====

Gaedo initially stood for "Google App Engine Data Object", but has since evolved into a more general Java persistence layer, supporting:

* Google App Engine
* Prevalence
* all graph implementations compatible with the Blueprints stack.

Since version 0.3.0, project documentation is available through [GitHub pages][1]. For reference, here are all versions' pages (sorted in reverse numeric order):
